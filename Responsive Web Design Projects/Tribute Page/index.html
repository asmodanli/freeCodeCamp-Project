        <ul>
          <li><strong>1986</strong> - Born in Chicago</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - He helped launch the Progressive Change
            Campaign Committee to learn more about effective online activism.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2010</strong> - He became a research fellow at Harvard
            University's Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption,
            directed by Lawrence Lessig. He founded the online group Demand
            Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Swartz was arrested by MIT police on state
            breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the
            MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to
            download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a
            guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors later
            charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of
            the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum
            penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset
            forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.

            <strong>2013</strong> - Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn
            apartment by his partner

          “Think deeply about things. Don’t just go along because that’s the way
          things are or that’s what your friends say. Consider the effects,
          consider the alternatives, but most importantly, just think.”
